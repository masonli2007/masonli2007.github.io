      	<h1>Luo Ji</h1>
      	
      	<p>Luo Ji was a classmate of Ye Wenjie's daughter Yang Dong in high school. He also has degrees in astronomy and sociology, and was a professor of sociology at Tsinghua University. However, he was irresponsible, opportunistic, and sensational in his research. </p>


      	<p>Later, due to his conversation with Ye Wenjie in front of Yang Dong's tomb, he was assassinated by the ETO organization and was selected as the fourth wall-facer of the Wall-Facing Project. From then on, he began his career of thinking about the law of the dark forest and fighting against the Three-Body Problem. </p>
